realworld data:
 - removed categorical data, now have exactly 30
 - generate info CSV for table, import to LaTeX (is ugly)

synthetic data:
 - have their parameters
 - - trying to find tools that will do it incl. sklearn mdcgen, ran out of time
 - they don't seem to say how many rows
 - couple of paragraphs I don't follow

document:
 - a few mods as per Renato. eg. titles for algs
 - started on defining conventions
 - - c&p k-means from proposal
 - started on adding algorithms ie. Yuan 2004
 - - c&p Euclidean from proposal
 - * def need feedback here before get too far

yuan:
 - moved to built-in sklearn and numbers don't match (Iris worse, Wine better)
 - nearest means to the mean?
 - operator precedence is ambiguous?
