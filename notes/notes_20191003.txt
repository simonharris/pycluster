realworld data:
 - removed categorical data, now have exactly 30
 - generate info CSV for table, import to LaTeX (is ugly)

synthetic data:
 - have their parameters
 - - checking what we can specify
 - - trying to find tools that will do it
 - they don't seem to say how many rows
 - couple of paragraphs I don't follow

todo:
 - look at that other library
