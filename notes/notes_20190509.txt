Done:
 - more time on Erisoglu. Finally get those "initial" means (M).
 - - now to reproduce some metrics
 - that confusion matrix alg (ie. when labels are different)
 - kmeans++
 - further on Hatamlou - not there yet

H/Questions:
 - 'objective function' versus summing function (metric)? (Suspect this is simple)
 - versus k-means

Questions:
 -

Todo:
 - continue with Hatamlou
 - implement more
 - implement a metric eg from Erisoglu
 - start combined experiments notebook
 - somethign with F-score
