Done:
 - more time on Erisoglu. Finally get those "initial" means (M).
 - - now to reproduce some metrics
 - that confusion matrix alg (ie. when labels are different)
 - kmeans++
 - further on Hatamlou (binary search) - (need to confirm numbers)
 - Babu (GA) - taking a while but no real problems yet
 - Started on Khan - early days

H/Questions:
 - 'objective function' versus summing function (metric)? (Suspect this is simple)
 - versus k-means

B/questions:
 - T is "threshold error"? (p.766)
 - m is "a constant"?

Todo:
 - continue with GA, Khan
 - implement more
 - implement a metric eg from Erisoglu
 - start combined experiments notebook
 - something with F-score

 Nb also:
  - Claire etc
  - - emailed PGRE team myself...
  - - - should continue to escalate?

  - bit of direction re abstract
