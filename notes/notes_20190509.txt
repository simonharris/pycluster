Nb date in filename wrong (paternity)


Done:
 - more time on Erisoglu. Finally get those "initial" means (M).
 - - now to reproduce some metrics
 - that confusion matrix alg (ie. when labels are different)
 - kmeans++
 - further on Hatamlou (binary search) - not there yet (not getting numbers)
 - stat on Babu (GA) - will take some time

H/Questions:
 - 'objective function' versus summing function (metric)? (Suspect this is simple)
 - versus k-means


Questions:
 - is SSE same as SSD? (nb. Residuals)
 - - and vs. Euclidean?
 - - - check understanding on how it fits with k-means?

Todo:
 - continue with Hatamlou
 - implement more
 - implement a metric eg from Erisoglu
 - start combined experiments notebook
 - something with F-score

 Nb also:
  - Claire etc
  - - emailed PGRE team myself...
  - - - should continue to escalate?
