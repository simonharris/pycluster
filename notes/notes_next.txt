So far:
 - reimplemented Khan
 - - can't get numbers, confused about normalization, Jenks
 - Likas/Global
 - - weird behaviour
 - Abstract/proposal progress
 - - further info from Jenny

Qu:
 - Khan: that normalized metric
 - Khan: Jenks algorithm...relevant/important, maybe hence some of the variation in numbers

 - What if a paper uses own initialisation, *and* modified kmeans? (Ismkhan, Khan-Jenks, possibly Likas/Global (for performance), Tzortzis/MinMax)
 - - fair to compare
 - - would need to implement?

To do:
 - progress on switching
