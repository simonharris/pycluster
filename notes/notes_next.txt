Code "review" in general done, with 1 exception...K&A


K & A:


Synthetic data gen: not big, just checking OK
 - "none less than 0.05"...but if K is 20...
 - with random cardinality, getting exactly 1000 is hard (random numbers 
   come out as floats so need rounding)
 
 
Algorithm specific params etc:
 - see other file
  

Alg specific "params":
 - Khan: select a column to cluster on
 - MacQueen: R and C, very dataset specific
 - ...tbc  

  
Computing access issues
 - got cluster access...tbc
 - VPN situation...tbc
 - Teamviewer...tbc
 - - SSH depends on VPN + knowing IP
  
  
Data output - how to handle
 - I have got this info coming out...tbc
 - The sort of quantity is...tbc
 - Not sure how to process it
 - - Some idea of final presentation might help
 
 
Algorithm presentation in paper:
 - how much detail needed?
 - - might be different for paper, dissertation?
 - LaTeX:
 - - Renato has conventions?
 - - too wide
 - - floats all over place
