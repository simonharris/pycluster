Onoda/ICA. return different numbers before I get to it!

NEW: Forgy vs. Faber
 - Forgy paper seems unavailable, conflicting reports
 - nb Steinley 2003 uses what I have as Forgy
NEW: KKZ 1994
 - mentioned a lot, 387 citation
 
Looked at KD trees but it seems the implementations don't expose the tree (nearest neighbours only)

UPDATED: Steinley (vs k-means)
 - have two of these! seems different so implemented another version
 - Spath reassignment step? (rarely in practice)
 - is it really an init?
 
MacQueen 1967
 - more involved/subtle than previously thought
 - chosing C/R accurately for datasets could be burdensome
  

Anything from university?
