Done:

 - B/Cancer dataset - fetch, clean, drop 16 NaNs, extract + convert labels
 - Soybean-small
 - consistency (metrics, algorithms, data sets)
 - - reducing code from notebooks
 - Half of MacQueen 1967
 - - 
 - Steinley:
 - - is it really an initialisation?
 - - isn't he just running k-means with many restarts?
 - - nb Hartigan data - 8 rows!
 - - seem to get same SSE as him, anyway
 
 Odd:
  - varying numbers eg. NMI even when algorithms are supposedly deterministic?
