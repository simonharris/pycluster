So far:
 - implemented Khan, couple of qus
 - Likas/Global
 - - weird behaviour
 - progress on Babu (GA; 228 citations)
 - - stuck on encoding/decoding
 - Abstract/proposal start...
 - - ...

Qu:
 - Khan: why/how cluster on one attribute
 - Khan: that normalized metric
 - Khan: why 5 clusters for Iris? Does it matter?
 - (Khan: Jenks algorithm)

 - What if a paper uses own initialisation, *and* modified kmeans? (Ismkhan, Khan-Jenks, possibly Likas/Global (for performance), Tzortzis/MinMax)
 - - fair to compare
 - - would need to implement?

To do:
 - outline of abstract
 - progress on switching
