NEW: Forgy vs. Faber
 - Forgy paper seems unavailable, conflicting reports
 - nb Steinley 2003 uses what I have as Forgy
NEW: KKZ 1994
 - mentioned a lot, 387 citations
UPDATED: Steinley (nb. vs. k-means)
 - have two of these! seems different so implemented another version
 - Spath reassignment step? (rarely in practice)
 - is it really an init?
UPDATED: MacQueen 1967 done
 - more involved/subtle than previously thought
 - chosing C/R accurately for datasets could be burdensome
NEW: SPSS 2010/2011
 - would like to reproduce eg. ARI though (mine is better?!)


ONGOING: Khan & Ahmad CCIA - PRL - c.635 citations
