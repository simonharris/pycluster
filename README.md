# pycluster

Experiments in Python data clustering algorithms, as research for my MSc project at the University of Essex.

## Structure

 - `initialisations/`: implementations of K-means initialisation algorithms
 - `metrics/`: implementations and wrappers of algorithms used to measure clustering success
 - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used to demonstrate clustering using the initialisations
 - `tests/`: unit tests
 - `kmeans.py`: implementation of K-means algorithm. It is not anticipated that this will be used for the experiments, though parts of it have been incorporated into implemented initialisations
